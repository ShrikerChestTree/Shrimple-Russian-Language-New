## FAQ
- **Q:** Why isn't block-lighting being ray traced?  
**A:** RT is off by default. Either change BLock Light > Mode to "Traced", or apply the "RTX" profile.

- **Q:** How do I make colored/dynamic/traced shadows work further from player/camera?  
**A:** You can increase the Block Lighting > Advanced > Horizontal/Vertical Bin Counts. Increasing the Bin Size option will also help, but it will educe the maximum "density" of light sources per area.

- **Q:** How do I make colored/dynamic/traced shadows faster?  
**A:** There are several options under Block Lighting > Advanced settings:
  - Reduce the Horizontal/Vertical Bin Counts to reduce the size of the light volume.
  - Reduce the Block Lighting > Advanced > Bin Size to use smaller bins (less blocks per bin).
  - Reduce the maximum number of lights per-bin.
  - Reduce the Range multiplier for lights.
